Product: Dell XPS 15 Laptop
Review: Good laptop overall but has some issues. The screen is beautiful and the keyboard is comfortable. Performance is solid for programming and video editing. However, it gets quite hot under load and the battery life is disappointing. The price is a bit high for what you get.
